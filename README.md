Vertical Play - Evaluating Market value of elite midfielders based on their ability to play vertical pass

#### Research Question : To evaluate the vertical passing abilities of elite midfield soccer players using the metrics verticality and depth and investigate the correlation with market value.

Data Collection : The dataset for this study included Opta event data from 282 matches of the top French soccer league (Ligue 1) in season 2020/21, which provides the match sheet and detailed contextual information at the time of each event. 

Result : 
The current study demonstrates that true midfielders and offensive midfielders exhibit a positive correlation between market value and the two metrics, verticality and depth.
Further analysis indicates that this correlation is particularly strong for players over 24 years old.
for wing midfielders, there is a positive correlation between age and market value. This can be attributed to the age distribution of different types of midfielders.

The mean ages of true midfielders and offensive midfielders are 26.1 and 26.2, respectively, while the mean age for wing midfielders is only 25.5. Wing midfielders often emerge at an early age because their role primarily requires speed, which is more prevalent in younger players. This results in early exposure and consistent improvement for young wing midfielders. In contrast, true and offensive midfielders require experience and a strong sense of positioning, attributes that are typically acquired with age, which cause some fluctuations in performance for the age group under 24.
